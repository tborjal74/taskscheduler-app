# Overview

{The Task Scheduler App is a Java written application that allows the user to add, update and remove tasks. It is also integrated with a calendar which expands its feature by allowing users to manage events.}

# Additional Programs 

{ 
- Local ATM Application - A Java written program that allows the user to check balance, withdraw cash amount and change PIN. The application does not have a GUI yet but runs in the terminal.
- Local Restaurant Ordering Application - A Java written application that allows user to add orders and gets the list of orders at the end.

}
{Software Description for All Programs:

# Task Scheduler App
- GUI Version - Since Java is an OOP language, a much better visual of the software can be used to access.
- Error Handling - The application ensures that no null entries are allowed when certain functions implemented in the buttons like add task, mark as completed, and remove tasks.
- CRUD Implementation - The local application applies the create, read, update and delete features of manipulating databases without an actual database setup. 
- Integrated Calendar - Users can add tasks or events and indicate the date and time for the input.

# Local ATM Application
- Console Based - The software runs in the local terminal for easier use and access.
- Error Handling - It ensures that user inputs are valid to run the whole program.

# Local Restaurant Ordering Application
- Console Based - The software runs in the local terminal for easier use and access.
- Error Handling - It ensures that user inputs are valid to run the whole program.
- Basic Data Structure - The program uses an ArrayList to add input data based on the orders selected.

# Purpose

{My purpose for writing these softwares is to demonstrate my simple and basic application of the Java language. It is also to display my capabilities in writing working software that has more rooms of improvement. }

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Implement a local database to save data added in the Task List. The time error handling will  also be fixed where users cannot add tasks without indicating a time. 
- Add a GUI and expand other features in the Local ATM for improve used experience. Add a Login feature that is connected to the database and PIN. Additional feature will be added where the balance will be subtracted when the user indicated a withdrawal ammount and displays the actual balance left.
- Improve the local restaurant order application by creating a GUI, allows the user to remove orders in the list. Additional feature where the quantities of order are indicated (e.g 2 burgers, 4 fries, 1 salad).
